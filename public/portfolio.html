    <div id="self-description">
      <p>
        Computers and technology have always been a huge part of my background. I grew up spending a majority of my
        days in front of a desktop computer or laptop, whether it was playing games, watching TV shows, or doing
        homework assignments. I mainly used my computer time for entertainment, but recently I’ve decided to utilize my
        above-average computer literacy to follow a more professional career path.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had first learned about the basic web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a web development class
        I took in my junior year of high school. I wasn’t looking to become a web developer at the time, but I
        <em>did</em> do very well in that class. A year later, I graduated high school with the goal of going into
        animation and becoming a storyboard artist. Unfortunately, due to the poor state of the Western animation
        industry, and because I had no real direction after dropping out of community college, I eventually gave up on that career choice. I then realized that computers were my second calling, so I decided to
        take the path of a developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started learning HTML and CSS again on my own, this time with both being more familiar to me in part to that class I took in high school. After that, I spent the next six months learning and studying JavaScript, doing every exercise I could to improve on it. I built a few projects on the side to further practice and apply everything I've learned, while learning new concepts in the process. A year later, I decided to return to college to get a degree in software engineering because I felt that a degree could open more opportunities for me. I’m currently looking for my very first position as a software engineer. and I’m continuing to learn and build new skills as consistently as possible to make that happen!

        <p>
          This is the first project I built for the Responsive Web Design course in freeCodeCamp. It's a survey form
          created for my own streaming service. It asks the user for their personal info as well as simple questions
          such as how they heard about the streaming service, what type of anime do they like, and what language do they
          prefer to watch anime. When it comes to HTML, this survey page features a moderate usage of checkboxes, radio
          buttons, and text fields.

        <h2>Technical documentation</h2>
        <p>
          This project was a technical documentation of the programming language of my choice. I chose Python since
          it's one of the most popular and widely-used languages in software development. I created sections for most of
          the different concepts in Python such as variables, strings, and conditional statements. I received all of my
          information from the Python Basics website.

        <h2>Product landing page</h2>
        <p>
          This was a project where I created a simple webpage promoting my imaginary streaming service to consumers. I
          set up a big banner discussing what my streaming service is about and placed an input text field for potential
          users to sign up using their e-mail address. I then embedded a YouTube video for the purpose of showing users
          the impact of streaming and how it's become a more viable option over cable TV. Finally, I created a pricing
          chart showing the different tiers of membership.

        <h2>Anime website</h2>
        <p>
          This is my own personal website that I've been working on for a while. It's mostly a basis for what I'd want my streaming service to look like. It takes some inspiration from Crunchyroll's home page, though it's not as
          advanced as theirs. I can't publicly deploy this site because it uses a lot of copyrighted images, but you can watch a quick demonstration of the site by clicking the link below.

        <h2>Yapper Messaging app</h2>

          This is my first major project I built in React. I used the CometChat JavaScript/React SDK to handle the
          basic functions of a messaging app such as sending and deleting messages and also displaying delivery/read
          receipts. I later used AWS to create a cloud backend for all user information and functions when I got to the
          deployment stage.

        <h2>Weather app</h2>
        <p>
          I personally consider this project to be one of my favorites. I had originally followed a tutorial from
          freeCodeCamp on how to build a weather app, but I went above and beyond and added plenty of new components to it as well as made use of more of the data being fetched through the OpenWeather API. This app does the basic things of a weather service such as showing the current conditions and eight-day forecast for a provided location. This is also the first project where I used TypeScript.

        <h2>State government website</h2>
        <p>
          I built this website for my Front End Web Development course in my software engineering degree program at WGU. I was assigned to to build a state government website that introduces the state and its major cities as well as attributes of the cities such as key places, population, and cost of living. I had first created a design template using Figma, then executed the code for the website based on my design.
