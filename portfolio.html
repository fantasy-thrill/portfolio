    <div id="self-description">
      <p>Computers and technology have always been a huge part of my background. I grew up spending a majority of my
        days in front of a desktop computer or laptop, whether it was playing games, watching TV shows, or doing
        homework assignments. I mainly used my computer time for entertainment, but recently I’ve decided to utilize my
        above-average computer literacy to follow a more professional career path.</p>

      <p>I had first learned about the basic web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a web development class
        I took in my junior year of high school. I wasn’t looking to become a web developer at the time, but I
        <em>did</em> do very well in that class. A year later, I graduated high school with the goal of going into
        animation and becoming a storyboard artist. Unfortunately, due to the poor state of the Western animation
        industry, that didn’t work out for me. I then realized that computers were my second calling, so I decided to
        take the path of a developer.
      </p>

      <p>I started learning HTML and CSS again, this time with both being more familiar to me in part to that class I
        took in high school. Then I spent the next six months learning and studying JavaScript, doing every exercise I
        could to improve on it. I’m currently looking for my very first position as a front end web developer and I’m
        continuing to learn and build new skills as consistently as possible to make that happen!</p>

        <h2>Survey form</h2>
        <p>This is the first project I built for the Responsive Web Design course in freeCodeCamp. It's a survey form
          created for my own streaming service. It asks the user for their personal info as well as simple questions
          such as how they heard about the streaming service, what type of anime do they like, and what language do they
          prefer to watch anime. When it comes to HTML, this survey page features a moderate usage of checkboxes, radio
          buttons, and text fields.</p>

        <h2>Technical documentation</h2>
        <p>This project was a technical documentation of the programming language of my choice. I chose Python since
          it's one of the most popular and widely-used languages in software development. I created setions for most of
          the different concepts in Python such as variables, strings, and conditional statements. I received all of my
          information from the Python Basics website.</p>

        <h2>Product landing page</h2>
        <p>This was a project where I created a simple webpage promoting my imaginary streaming service to consumers. I
          set up a big banner discussing what my streaming service is about and placed an input text field for potential
          users to sign up using their e-mail address. I then embedded a YouTube video for the purpose of showing users
          the impact of streaming and how it's become a more viable option over cable TV. Finally, I created a pricing
          chart showing the different tiers of membership.</p>

        <h2>Anime website</h2>
        <p>This is my own personal website that I've been working on for a while. It's mostly what I'd want my streaming
          service to look like. It takes some inspiration from Crunchyroll's home page, though it's not as advanced as
          theirs. You can find out more info about this project in the README.md file on its GitHub repository.</p>

        <h2>Yapper Messaging app</h2>
        <p>This is my first major project I built in React. I used the CometChat JavaScript/React SDK to handle the
          basic functions of a messaging app such as sending and deleting messages and also displaying delivery/read
          receipts. It's still in development and will have more necessary features added to it soon.</p>

        <h2>Weather app</h2>
        <p>I personally consider this project to be one of my favorites. I had originally followed a tutorial from freeCodeCamp on how to build a weather app, but I went above and beyond and added plenty of new components to it as well as made use of more of the data being fetched through the OpenWeather API. This app does the basic things of a weather service such as showing the current conditions and eight-day forecast for a provided location. This is also the first project where I used TypeScript.</p>
